Exceptions
- No Error - Running well

1 Syntax Error - Compile Time Error (Generate by Compiler)
	- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - Create, Save, Open, Edit, Compile, Run Program - Eclipse/Netbeans/DrJava/BlueJ 
	- Solutions - Compiler will provide the suggestion about the Error

2. Logical Error - Debugging tools
	- Each and every line of code - observe and find the problem
	- Stop Point, Step Into (Next Line), Step-over (Next Line), Start Debug, Stop Debug

3. Exception Handling - Runtime Error Handling
	- try .... catch.....finally
	
	
	variable(s) declare	
	try{
		input, process, output
	}
	catch(Exception ex){
		print error message
	}	
	finally{
		print finally message
		free memory addresses
		closes all open contents  (file, connections, other)
	}
	
	try->if error found -> move to catch ->print error message ->move to finally -> do some tasks
	try->if no errors -> move to finally -> do some tasks
	
4. User Defined Exceptions
- Value validation (range error/type error) error generate by user.
